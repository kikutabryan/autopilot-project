# autopilot-project
Autonomous vehicle controller written in C++ to run on an Arduino Nano microcontroller.

Utilized the following components:
- Arduino Nano
- MPU9250 IMU
- GPS Unit
- Servo Motors

This was a project which I worked on in 2020 out of pure fascination and curiosity with self-controlled vehicles.
